> Build the astropy, sep, numpy, and scipy packages and strip them down to run in Lambda

This repo contains a `build.sh` script that's intended to be run in an Amazon Linux docker container, and build astropy, sep, numpy, and scipy for use in AWS Lambda. For more info about how the script works, and how to use it, see the blog post by `ryansb` [on deploying sklearn to Lambda](https://serverlesscode.com/post/scikitlearn-with-amazon-linux-container/).

This repository is a fork of the excellent work by `ryanb` in https://github.com/ryansb/sklearn-build-lambda .

To build the zipfile, pull the Amazon Linux image and run the build script in it.

```
$ docker pull amazonlinux:2017.09
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/outputs -it amazonlinux:2017.09 /bin/bash /outputs/build.sh
```

That will make a file called `venv.zip` in the local directory that's around 50MB.

Once you run this, you'll have a zipfile containing astropy, sep, numpy, scipy and their dependencies. This repository also contains a file called `process.py` which imports these packages and detects sources with [SEP package](http://sep.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.x/) (based on Source Extractor).

## Extra Packages

To add extra packages to the build, add them to the `requirements.txt` file alongside the `build.sh` in this repo. All packages listed there will be installed in addition to those already described in [`build.sh`](https://github.com/spacetelescope/astropy-sep-lambda/blob/f3f34a6c1b8e6bd451de5c8ff6dc1f5e5cd193f8/build.sh#L18-L20)

## Testing locally

Testing Lambda locally is a pain, but thanks to the efforts of the Lambci folks in https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda, we can test a function locally as follows:

First, build the Lambda function locally with the command from above:

```
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/outputs -it amazonlinux:2017.09 /bin/bash /outputs/build.sh
```

This should leave you with a `venv.zip` file. Unzip this with:

```
$ unzip venv.zip -d venv
```
Next enter the `venv` directory and try running the command, passing in your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables:

```
$ cd venv
$ docker run --rm -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='XXXXXXXXX' -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='XXXXXXXXX' -v "$PWD":/var/task lambci/lambda:python2.7 process.handler '{"s3_output_bucket": "dsmo-lambda-test-outputs", "fits_s3_key":"hst/public/icsc/icsca0voq/icsca0voq_drz.fits", "fits_s3_bucket":"stpubdata"}'
```
## Sizing and Future Work

In its current form, this set of packages weighs in at 50MB and could probably be reduced further by:

1. Pre-compiling all .pyc files and deleting their source
1. Removing test files
1. Removing documentation

According to [this article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html) the size limit for a zipped Lambda package (the `venv.zip` file) is 50MB, however, reading around it seems like Lambda is tolerant of significantly larger packages when the zipped package is posted to S3.
